# In the worst case, WSGI processes are CPU bound. Running more workers than
# available CPU cores could cause excessive context switching / thrashing
# and lower overall server throughput. However, our CPU utilization data shows
# that servers are nowhere close to CPU capacity when WSGI process count is
# equivalent to CPU core count. So, we run more WSGI processes than cores.
