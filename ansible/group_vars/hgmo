# The string used by zookeeper.connect is used both to connect to

# we were to put actual hostnames in this string, the future removal
# of the host may cause Kafka to blow up. It appears the best practice
# is to always Zookeeper on the local machine and connect to
# localhost:2181. This ensures that future host juggling continues
