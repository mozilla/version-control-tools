SSH with a valid key gives us warning about no command. Also prints note about
lack of LDAP group membership.

  $ hgmo add-ssh-key user1@example.com - < key1.pub
  $ ssh -T -F ssh_config -i key1 -l user1@example.com -p $HGPORT $SSH_SERVER
  A SSH connection has been successfully established.
  
  Your account (user1@example.com) has privileges to access Mercurial over
  SSH.
  
  You are NOT a member of any LDAP groups that govern source control access.
  
  You will NOT be able to push to any repository until you have been granted
  commit access.
  
  See https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/commit/access-policy/ for
  more information.
  
  You did not specify a command to run on the server. This server only

  $ ssh -T -F ssh_config -i key1 -l hgdisabled@example.com -p $HGPORT $SSH_SERVER
  A SSH connection has been established, your account (hgdisabled@example.com)
  was found in LDAP, and your account has been configured for Mercurial
  access.
  
  However, Mercurial access is currently disabled on your account.
  This commonly occurs due to account inactivity (you need to SSH
  into hg.mozilla.org every few months to keep your account active).
  
  To restore Mercurial access, please file a bug on Bugzilla under
  the `mozilla.org :: Repository Account Requests` component and
  request access be restored for hgdisabled@example.com.

Failure to connect to LDAP mirror locks us out
What happens here is nscd caches the valid passwd entry lookup for the user.
However, the SSH key lookup via LDAP fails and this manifests as no public keys
available.
