This helps us query information about Mozilla's Mercurial repositories.

Documentation found in here:

Important notes from the pushlog documentation::

    When implementing agents that consume pushlog data, please keep in mind
    the following best practices:

    * Query by push ID, not by changeset or date.
    * Always specify a startID and endID.
    * Try to avoid full if possible.
    * Always use the latest format version.
    * Don't be afraid to ask for a new pushlog feature to make your life easier.
