# yum will incur network traffic when URLs are specified. Download the

# Mercurial 4.3 dropped support for Python 2.6, which CentOS 6 uses.
# Mercurial can build a self-contained RPM (containing Python 2.7) for CentOS 6.
# We don't really use CentOS 6 any more (the only thing in this Ansible install
# still using it is MozReview, which is going away), so we keep CentOS 6 on
# the last Python 2.6-supported Mercurial.
