"""
Advanced URL Interceptor extension to intercept URL requests originating from
mercurial.urllibcompat and mock the response instead of sending any real
requests.

The interceptor can be configured using a JSON file consisting of URLs as keys,
and data and/or status code as values.

Here is an example configuration:

    {
        "https://example.org/": {"code": 200, "data": "Hello, world!"},
        "https://example.com/": {"code": 404},
        "https://example.ca/": {"code": null},
    }

In the above configuration, the interceptor will return a 200 status code and
"Hello, world!" as the body if a request is made to https://example.org/. It
will raise an HTTPError with a status code of 404 if a request is made to
https://example.com/, and it will raise a URLError if a request is made to
https://example.ca/.

Possible values for "code" include an integer (this will be used directly when
creating the HTTPError exception), or None (null in JSON) which will cause a
URLError to be raised.
