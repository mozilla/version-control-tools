# To use docker-compose for running the test environment you must
# create a `.env` file with the following contents:
#     UID=<uid-of-your-host-machine-user>
#     GID=<gid-of-your-host-machine-user>
#     DOCKER_GID=<gid-of-the-host-machine-docker-group>
#
# To create the `.env` file, you can run:
# `$ ./run env > .env`
#
# Here is an example of my `.env` file at time of writing:
#     UID=1000
#     GID=1000
#     DOCKER_GID=975
#
# The environment may be built by running:
# `$ docker-compose build`
#
# Non-docker tests may be run with:
# `$ docker-compose run --rm test-runner`
#
# The test-runner docker image runs `./create-environment test`
# with NO_DOCKER=1, since that relys on the host docker daemon.
# The containers for docker tests can be built by running:
# `$ docker-compose run --rm test-runner ./d0cker build-all`
#
# The full test-suite with docker tests can be run with:
# `$ docker-compose run --rm test-runner /vct/run-tests`
